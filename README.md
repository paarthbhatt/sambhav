## Features

1. **Battery Data Visualization**
   - Interactive charts and graphs for performance analysis.
   - Support for multiple data formats (CSV, JSON).

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Live updates of critical battery parameters, such as voltage, current, and charge.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple and clean design for seamless data exploration.
   - Mobile-responsive layout for accessibility across devices.

4. **Export and Share**
   - Download reports and share insights with collaborators.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing historical data).
- **Deployment**: Docker, Netlify/AWS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/battery-data-preview.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd battery-data-preview
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following details:

   ```
   DATABASE_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data**:
   - Import battery performance data in CSV or JSON format.

2. **Visualize Metrics**:
   - View charts and graphs for parameters like voltage, current, temperature, and charge cycles.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Watch live updates for ongoing battery performance tests.

4. **Download Reports**:
   - Export analysis as PDF or CSV for further use.
